# short summary
# ðŸ§  Next.js + Auth + Env Summary

- `page.js` and `layout.js` are **hardcoded filenames** in the `app/` directory used for routing and layout structure.
- Next.js supports **file-based routing**, meaning folder structure defines the routes (`/about/page.js` becomes `/about`).
- `.env.local` is a **hardcoded filename** used to store sensitive environment variables like API keys or DB URIs.
- Variable **names in `.env.local` are not hardcoded**; you can define custom names and reference them via `process.env.YOUR_VAR`.
- `route.js` (when used) is a **custom file**, not hardcoded â€” but is commonly created by devs to manage routes cleanly (especially in React, not required in Next.js).
- OAuth (e.g., GitHub, Google) allows users to log in via their credentials; it's set up using provider client ID/secret stored in `.env.local`.

- onlClick{()=>{signIn("github)}}, without arrow function then argument starts executing on rendering itself

- hardcoded Files : [username], page.js, layout.js, .env.local

- Use <Link> for internal navigation in Next.js to preserve React state and avoid full page reloads, unlike <a> which resets the app and loses state data. Use <Link> for user-initiated navigation and useRouter().push() for programmatic redirects in code logic.

# 1 ðŸ“š Routing in React vs Next.js
React uses `react-router-dom` for routing, requiring manual setup and component-based route declarations.  
Next.js uses file-based routing where special files like `page.js` and `layout.js` are hardcoded entry points.  
In React, routes are mapped in `App.js`, while in Next.js, file structure directly defines the routes.  
Next.js simplifies dynamic routing with folder names like `[id]`, and handles navigation with `Link` and `useRouter`.  
Choose React for full routing control; choose Next.js for convention, speed, and SEO benefits.


# 2
In Next.js App Router, routing is based on special file names like `page.js` and `layout.js`.  
These are hardcoded conventionsâ€”`page.js` defines the routeâ€™s content, and `layout.js` defines the UI wrapper.  
Each `page.js` is automatically passed as the `children` prop to the nearest `layout.js`.  
Layouts commonly include shared UI like `<Navbar />` and `<Footer />` around the page.  
This structure keeps your app clean, modular, and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).

## 3-Liner Summary
The `/dashboard` route was being overridden by the `[username]` dynamic route because they were on the same level.  
I fixed it by creating a static `dashboard/` folder directly inside `app/`, so Next.js prioritizes it over the dynamic route.  

## 4-Liner Explanation
- Next.js uses **file-system routing** where folder names map to URLs.  
- **Static routes** (e.g., `dashboard/`) always take priority over **dynamic routes** (e.g., `[username]/`) at the same hierarchy level.  
- If both exist as siblings, `/dashboard` will resolve to the static folder first.  
- Placing `dashboard/` in `app/` alongside `[username]/` ensures `/dashboard` is not treated as a username.  


## 5- Problems
1. Using onBlur with Link - link ka link chal nahi raha tha bcz onBlur option's ko pehle hi band ker de rhaa tha, i.e link ka href fire hi nahi hu rhaa tha.

## 6- Yes â€” when you use session in NextAuth, youâ€™re automatically using this JWT verification system under the hood (unless you switch to a database session strategy).

## 7-So useSession() or getServerSession() is basically reading the verified JWT and giving you the user info it contains

## 8-Without server actions

Client âž¡ fetch() âž¡ API route âž¡ Database âž¡ Return JSON âž¡ Render

With server actions

Client âž¡ directly call server function (skips API route) âž¡ Database âž¡ Return


## 9-script vs Script-nextjs-component
In Next.js, <Script> is a built-in component for loading and optimizing external scripts with control over load timing (beforeInteractive, afterInteractive, lazyOnload).

<script> is the standard HTML tag for adding JavaScript, but it lacks Next.jsâ€™s built-in optimizations.

Use <Script> in Next.js when you want performance benefits and controlled execution, and plain <script> only for very basic inline or static use cases.
